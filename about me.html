    <h2 class="color">All About Me </h2>
    <p class="light"> my name is manuel i was born in berkley california, my parents were born
    in pajuacaran which is in michoacan, and my mom was born right next to 
    pajuacaran but i forgot how that place is called. i was raised in oakland 
    but i actually lived in washignton in 2012 when i was 7, i lived their for 
    a years. and i also like to play video games ive actually spent a quite bit on games, but yeah i like video games ive been on playstation for about 7 years now, since the playstation 2. im nice ig well went i want to be and feel the vibez, i work now well during the weekends i get paid for my age ig i get payed good, i work with my family they have a family job soo yea, i dont really play as much as i used too because now i actually have more things to do(not talking about school, school is boring) so i dont play as much as i used too maybe 1/4 of as much as i played before. now i play like 1-3 hours imagine how much i used to play before almost all day. i wouldnt say that i commit myself to school because if i wanted too i could honestly do way better than im doing rn but i dont bc i am lazy and yea its obvious but if i commited than i would definitely be way better. </p>
